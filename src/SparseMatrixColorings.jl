    SparseMatrixColorings

Coloring algorithms for sparse Jacobian and Hessian matrices.

The algorithms implemented in this package are all taken from the following survey:

> [_What Color Is Your Jacobian? Graph Coloring for Computing Derivatives_](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0036144504444711), Gebremedhin et al. (2005)

Some parts of the survey (like definitions and theorems) are also copied verbatim or referred to by their number in the documentation.
